# Object Counting with UNET Density Estimation

## Overview
This repository houses a project focused on object counting in images using a UNET-based model for density map estimation. The approach involves training a UNET architecture to predict density maps, which are then used to count objects within the images. The project is designed to handle scenarios where accurate object counting is crucial, such as in crowd monitoring, traffic analysis, or other applications.

## Key Features
- **UNET Model for Density Estimation**: The core of the project is a UNET architecture, a popular convolutional neural network (CNN) design, employed for estimating density maps from input images. This enables the model to understand the distribution and concentration of objects within the visual data.
- **Object Counting**: The density maps generated by the UNET model are utilized to count objects in the images accurately. The approach is particularly useful in scenarios where traditional object detection methods might face challenges, such as crowded scenes.
- **Versatile Applications**: The trained model can be applied to a variety of scenarios, including crowd counting in public spaces, vehicle counting in traffic scenes, or any other use case where quantifying the number of objects in an image is essential.
